title: About Thierry Darrigrand
---

Working in an International Oil Company, I share my spare time between my two main hobbies: baroque music and software development ... and sometimes building some bridges between the two.

The aim of this blog is mainly a self assessment of my learnings in order to push me to make some progress. 

It is a way also to feed back what I have received from others, through their blogs or their teachings or their discussions and to share it again with others.
